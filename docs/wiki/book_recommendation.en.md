# Recommended Book List

## Basic Theory Series

1. [Quantum Chemistry](https://book.douban.com/subject/20062049/) 
    
    Quantum mechanics fundamentals tailored for chemistry students, with detailed calculations.

2. [Modern Quantum Chemistry](https://book.douban.com/subject/1440838/)
    
    A classic textbook on quantum chemistry, with a highlight on the Hartree-Fock theory.

3. [The Electronic Structure and Chemistry of Solids](https://book.douban.com/subject/11752716/)
    
    Qualitative solid-state physics suitable for chemistry students, providing a basic understanding of solid-state physics.

4. [Statistical Mechanics](https://book.douban.com/subject/4669257/)
    
    A comprehensive introduction to statistical mechanics with detailed formula derivations. Serious study will provide a relatively deep understanding of statistical mechanics.

5. [Second Quantized Approach to Quantum Chemistry](https://book.douban.com/subject/11566290/)
    
    As stated in the preface of this book, it is designed to introduce chemists (non-physicists) to the language of second quantization. If you want to delve into second quantization in detail for literature reading, I highly recommend this book. As the author says, you will only appreciate the beauty of second quantization once you start using it.
